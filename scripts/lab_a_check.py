"""Lab A finish line: does each machine's health show its "specialty"
(its most-brewed drink)? Run from the repo root:

    uv run scripts/lab_a_check.py

Green means: /api/machines/{id} now reports each machine's most-brewed drink,
and it's the right one for every machine — so the query is real, not hardcoded.
Then open the dashboard and confirm the specialty shows on each machine card.
